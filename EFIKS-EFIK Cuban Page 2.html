                            <p>To appreciate the containment of Abakua lodges to particular port cities of western
                                Cuba-in spite of the global travels of its members as well as the kua group desire of
                                some to establish lodges abroad-it is instructive to note a paral tyof these lel movement
                                in the Yoruba-centered Cuban practice of Ifa, noting that its an groups reestablishment
                                is a simpler process. Like Abakua, Ifa is thought to have been established in Cuba in the
                                first half of the nineteenth cent~ry. 32 Before the {oruba Ifa 1959 Revolution, the
                                estimated two hundred babalawos in Cuba all knew each other. 33 By the 1990S,
                                leading Cuban babalawos gave me estimates of ten thou Cuban sand to describe their
                                numbers, and neophytes were arriving from throughout nsmis the Americas, Europe,
                                and elsewhere to receive Ifa consecrations and travel [)IDe to home with them. lOt the
                                In 1978, highly specialized Ifa ceremonies performed in Miami were geared lict the to
                                reproduce there the foundation of Ifa in Cuba some 150 years earlier.34 The in the
                                ceremonies were led by Nigerian babalawo Ifayemi ElebU.ibQn Awise (chief Ifa In this
                                priest) of Osogbo, who traveled to Miami for the occasion.Two of the partici knows
                                pating Cuban babalawo were also Abakua leaders, Luis Fernandez-Pelon, who IlS. Be 35
                                was initiated as a babalawo in Nigeria, and Jose-Miguel G6mez, both of whom Ie with
                                are cited in this study.36 This Ifa reestablishment ceremony was led by one babalawo,
                                while Abakua consecrations involve scores of initiated men acting in concert, in
                                addition to the required tributes paid to the existing lodges in Cuba. Jose-Miguel
                                Gomez was an Abakua leader who ran for the political office of councilman in
                                Sweetwater, Florida, in 1991. Gomez was the Mokango of his lodge Ebian Efa from 1926</p>

                            Gomez left several unpublished essays about Abakua history in Cuba and Africa. He thus exemplified Abakua activity in Florida: he did not create
                            a lodge or lead ceremonies, even though he was a master; instead, he studied the Cuban past and African mythology while passing it on to fellow
                            initiates.</p>

                        <div class="col-12">
                            <p>Abakua activities in Miami in the first decade of the twenty-first century have been
                                ignited by recent face-to-face encounters between Abakua members and their
                                Nigerian and Cameroonian counterparts in the United States. These encounters began
                                in 2001 when an Abakua performance troupe participated in the Efik National
                                Association of USA meeting in Brooklyn, New York. In 2003, two Abakua leaders
                                traveled to Michigan to meet the Obong (Paramount Ruler) of Calabar during another
                                Efik National Association meeting. In 2004, two Abakua musicians traveled to Calabar,
                                Nigeria, to participate in the annual International Ekpe Festival. In 2007, an Ekpe troupe
                                from Calabar and an Abakua troupe performed together onstage in Paris for five
                                concerts celebrating their common raditions. Then in 2009, those Abakua living in the
                                United States who went to Paris produced a CD recording that fused music and ritual
                                phrases from both groups. Called Ecobio Enyenison, “Our Brothers from Africa,” it also
                                included the participation of a Cuban artist named Jose Orbein, whose painting
                                appears on the jacket (fig. 16.5), and an Abakua singer named Angel Guerrero, both
                                based in Miami. All of this activity has energized Abakua communities in Miami, where
                                Guerrero has also acted as an entrepreneur by sharing information about African Ekpe
                                with his ritual brothers and organizing them in cultural events that have been
                                advertised on the internet and recorded in video programs.</p>

                            <p>The first cultural event in Miami was billed as an “Abakua fiesta” (party or feast) to
                                ensure that it was not misinterpreted as an initiation ritual (fig.16.6). It was held on
                                February 8,2009, in a private home with a large patio to accommodate the drumming,
                                dancing, and food preparations where hundreds gathered. A second party was held on
                                August 2, 2009, to celebrate Guerrero’s birthday. After these general events for the
                                entire community, members of particular Cuban lodges living in Miami began to
                                celebrate the anniversary of their lodge’s foundation. On February 24, 2010, the
                                members of the lodge Itia Mukanda Ef6 gathered with friends to celebrate the
                                anniversary of their founding in 1947 in Havana.</p>

                        <p>On January 2 and 3, 2010 , in Miami, members of two Havana lodges from the same lineage, Efori Enkomon (founded 1840) and Ekue Munyanga
                            Ef6 (founded 1871), celebrated a feast to adore the La Virgin de la Caridad (the Virgin of Charity), the patron saint of the Munyanga lodge and also
                            of the Cuban nation (fig. 16.7). This saint is popularly understood as a dimension of Ochun,the Lukumi/Yoruba goddess of fertility, who for Abakua
                            also represents Sikan, their Sacred Mother.This date was chosen for being a weekend near January 6, known as “Abakua day,” the anniversary of
                            the colonial-era Three King’s Day processions wherein African “nation-groups” would perform their traditional dances and greet the governor
                            general in Havana. This day was chosen to found the Abakua society in Cuba because they were able to use the mass celebration as a cover for
                            their own activities. On September 14 and 15, 2010, members of the Havana lodge Amiabon (founded in 1867) gathered, apparently for their own
                            anniversary (fig. 16.7). The most recent feast was “Abakua day” on January 8, 2011, in Miami at a private home (fig. 16.8).</p>

                        <p>These activities have been meaningful to Abakua on either side of the “Rum Curtain.” Angel Guerrero (2011) reported that Abakua had little
                            opportunity to communicate across the Gulf Stream from the 1960s to the 1980s: “Because of the rupture in communications between those
                            who left and those who stayed, many members willing to send money to help their lodges in Cuba were impeded. Also,many Abakua lodges
                            performed ceremonies without knowing that some of their brothers in exile had passed away.” In Cuba, as in West Africa, when a lodge member
                            dies, all lodge activities are suspended until the proper rites are enacted. In the United States since the first decade of the twenty-first century,
                            Guerrero reports: Now with mobile phones, faxes and internet we receive news instantly.Experience has taught me that the links between
                            Abakua members obliges one to see the condition of exile in a specific way. Our solidarity makes us think about how we can help our brothers
                            so that they have a more dignified life, because in essence this is part of the oath we made upon initiation in the society Ekoria Enyene Abakua
                            [full name of the AbakuaJ. Through all the gatherings so far here in Miami our greatest achievement has been to gather and unite all those
                            brothers who had been divorced from their lodges in Cuba, so that now they are actively supporting their lodges. Thanks to Abasi [Supreme
                            BeingJ this achievement has already benefited many lodges in Havana and Matanzas. Today we are stronger than ever, because “In Unity,
                            Strength!” Abakua gatherings in Miami were inspired by the recent communication with African Ekpe members; contact with Africans
                            confirmed that their inherited lore really did come from African masters. In other words, instead of simply assimilating into the values and
                            systems of North America and forgetting their past, many Abakua have opted to accept responsibility for their oaths of solidarity, thus renewing
                            ties with their Cuban lodge members. Instead of an abstract or nostalgic relationship to African Ekpe and Cuban lodges, Abakua in Miami are
                            emerging as actors in an international movement within the Ekpe-Abakua continuum of exchanging ideas, and of reassessing the values of their
                            inherited traditions for the identity of their communities.</p>

                        <p>From the late nineteenth century to the present in Cuba, there has existed anartistic
                            tradition of using Abakua themes in music, theater, and painting as a symbol of the
                            Cuban nation itself. This tradition has continued among Cuban artists living in Florida
                            today.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>Mario Sanchez (1908-2005) is an early example of an artist working in Key West who
                            documented carnivalesque popular dances in the early twentieth century. Because he
                            depicted various styles of body-mask performance, includingAbakua heme and Puerto
                            Rican Vejigantes, some scholars interpreted this as evidence for Abakua rites occurring
                            in Key West.Sanchez was more likely exploring issues of identity and cultural
                            performance, as did other artists mentioned in this essay. Artists have been creating
                            images of freme for numerous purposes, none of which provide evidence for Abakua
                            ritual activity in Florida. Instead they are examples of artists honoring their Cuban
                            traditions,their memories of Cuban identity, and so on. The next three artists (discussed
                            below) are not Abakua members, yet as males from the western part of the island
                            where Abakua is practiced, they understand its important role in Cuban history and
                            identity and incorporate Abakua motifs in their work. Some have gone further to study
                            the literature, especially that of Lydia Cabrera.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>In addition to promoting Abakua events artistically, Jose Orbein (b. 1951) has painted
                            many series depicting esoteric aspects ofAbakua tradition. Living in Miami, Orbein was
                            born and raised in the Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Havana, a barrio named in homage
                            to the exiled Cubans living in Key West who supported the independence movement
                            against Spain in the nineteenth century. Orbein wrote: “Now living in Miami, I’m using
                            influences of the Abakua in my canvases. I’m a strong believer of the society who was
                            raised admiring and respecting all the Efori Enkomon ekobios [brothers] of my

                            generally inspired his creative process, but his collaborations in Miami with Abakua
                            singer Angel Guerrero have led to a series of Abakua themes with specific imagery and
                            titles based upon deep knowledge. For example, Orbein’s Obonekue Arabensuao (fig.

                            the “Ireme Eribanganda,” a body-mask used to lead processions during initiation
                            ceremonies, implying that “Abakua is moving forward” (fig. 16.7).The use of the colors
                            and star of the Cuban flag are another statement that Abakua is “as Cuban as black
                            beans and rice.” Participants have reported that in Cuba, the use of a Cuban flag on an
                            Ireme could lead to conflicts with the authorities, a reminder that Abakua

                            <p>Painter Elio Beltran (b. 1929) was born and raised in RegIa, a small industrial town on the
                                Bay of Havana where Abakua was founded in the 1830s. Still a vital center for
                                African-derived community traditions, RegIa is home to scores of active Abakua lodges.
                                From his home in Florida, Beltran wrote: “I grew up registering dream-like images in
                                my mind during my childhood years. Images that many years later would emerge as oil
                                paintings to help me to ease my pain of separation from the very dear surroundings
                                and people that I loved in Cuba.” A series of paintings reflect the impact of an Abakua
                                heme (body mask) performance on the young artist. Asustados Intrusos, or “Scared
                                Intruders” (1981), depicts “three scared kids hiding and secretly watching an Abakua
                                initiation in the early 1940’S behind the tall grass at the edge of a cliff in the night.I
                                believe it was the Otan Efa brotherhood of the Abakua on the out skirts of my
                                hometown Regla.I was one of the three boys overlooking the scene of the celebration
                                on the site at the entrance to what was known then as El callej6n del Sapo.” A second
                                painting, Ceremonia Secreta (1987), depicts the same event from 180 degrees (fig.
                                16.10). These paintings are remarkable for depicting how a hermetic club became
                                famous among non-initiates who were awed by the communal rites.</p>

                                    shows how elements of African-derived traditions (an Abakua mask, a bata drum, a

                                    fused in the citywide celebrations. In all of these works, one senses the profound
                                    impact of an Abakua mask performance on the young viewer, as well as the

                            Cabrera wrote,”I do not forget the terror that the ireme instilled in Federico Garda Lorca, nor the delirious poetic description he made for me the

                        <p>A multidisciplinary visual/installation and performance artist, Leandro Soto (b. 1956) was a leading figure in Cuban art in the 1980s and among
                            the first artists in his generation to explore Afro-Cuban themes. Based in Miami since the 1990S, Soto began to work with Abakua imagery in the
                            first decade of the twenty-first century after learning about the Kachina body-masks of Hopi people of the American Southwest. He created a
                            series of video-installation performance pieces with Abakua imagery that presented the artist as an Abakua mask-here a symbol of Cuba
                            itself-who encounters a kindred tradition in North America.Soto’s Abakua series generally celebrates motion through Abakua body-masks and
                            coded symbolism imagery (fig. 16.11; see detail in fig. 3.3). During this process, Soto conversed extensively with Angel Guerrero,studied Lydia
                            Cabrera’s publications, and also reproduced nineteenth-century Abakua signatures for Miller’s book on Abakua history, The Voice ofthe Leopard

                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>It is remarkable that the Abakua cultural movement has been able to expand from ritual secrecy in Havana and Matanzas onto the global stage
                            of performance in the process of communicating meaningfully with African practitioners of Ekpe-the source tradition from which it was
                            separated some two hundred years ago.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>As with other cases of oral transmission across long time and space intervals, such as the Vedic and Homeric poems, the Abakua example
                            combines intensive artistic discipline with a ritualized guild framework. As the present moment of history is witnessing the reconnection of the
                            two ends of this vast diasporal arc, the impact of this encounter on the local communities of practitioners is fascinating to observe. At the same
                            time, the public nature of the new encounter is eliciting unprecedented openness to scholarly access,which promises to enrich the description
                            of each of the local traditions that were heretofore so closely guarded from outside view. This chapter documents the participation ofAbakua
                            members in Florida in this process, as well as their allies in the arts who honor and celebrate Abakua as part of an overall Cuban national identity.
                            Eventually, the global Ekpe-Abakua network may develop its own organic scholarship from within, such has happened already to an extent with
                            the Yoruba-Lukumi tradition.</p>

                            <li>An 1882 publication on “The Criminals of Cuba” began a chapter on the “Nyanyigos” by stating: “The police have worked hard to eradicate the
                                nyanyigos” (Trujillo, Loscriminales de Cuba, 360). A ~90~ publication on Spanish penal colonies stated: “Finally, the nyanyigo was conceived of as
                                a dangerous being, shown clearly by the mass deportations during the last period of our dominion, that accumulated a large number of
                                nyanyigos in Ceuta, in Cadiz,and in the Castle of Figueras” (Salillas, “Los fiafiigos en Ceuta,” 339).<br>
                                In 1925 a study of the history of RegIa, the birthplace of Abakua in Cuba, had a chapter called “Criminality and Nyanyagismo in RegIa” (Duque,
                                Historia de Regia, 125-27). A 1930 publication in Cuba asked rhetorically if Abakua was related to “abominable crimes”: “In Cuba, are witchcraft and
                                nyanigism religious practices or black magic? … Is it true that they shelter organizations dedicated to the most abominable crimes?” (Martin,
                                Ecue,chango y yemaya, 7). This contextualization of Abakua continues into the present. In 2011 in Havana a monograph was published with the
                                title “The Abakua Society and the Stigma of Criminality” (Perez-Martinez y Torres-Zayas).</li>

                                to Key West and later to Tampa, seeking employment in the cigar factories and other industries. Others were revolutionary patriots seeking

                            <li>Telephone conversation with Stetson Kennedy, April 2002. Kennedy referred to his lack of fluency in Spanish. Describing research among a
                                Cuban family in Tampa, he wrote: “When the cooking is over and the meal placed on the table, there is a sudden burst of very rapid and excited
                                Spanish which I am unable to understand” (“All He’s Living For,” 21). In a letter to the author, Kennedy (2002) wrote: “I do not know much about
                                naniguismo beyond what I have read in Dr. Fernando Ortiz’s Los Negros Brujos … and my own article.” In his next letter, Kennedy (2002) wrote: “I
                                do not now recall the contents of my nanigo article, or whether it even implied that there might have been nanigo organizations in Florida. I
                                suspect that it would be difficult to prove either that there had been, or had not been.”</li>
                            <li>“Recent folklore recording expeditions conducted by the Florida Work Projects Administration of the Library of Congress located a number of
                                people in Key West and Tampa, besides those already mentioned, who undoubtedly have an initiate’s knowledge of Nanigo, obtained both in
                                Cuba and locally…. But because of their extreme poverty,they refuse absolutely to perform without some pecuniary remuneration-which
                                unfortunately was unavailable to the WPA expeditions” Kennedy, “Naiiigos in Florida,” 155). If Abakua groups did exist in Florida, they would have
                                performed ceremonies, aspects of them public, to which WPA researchers could have gone. Lacking such groups, there was only “fragmentary
                                mention” of a masked dancer and a bongo. I did locate testimonies of Cubans and Spaniards who had lived in Cuba, Key West, and Tampa,
                                conducted in Ybor City and Tampa in the late 1930S. The Federal Writers’ Project Papers housed in the University of North Carolina Library at
                                Chapel Hill contain descriptions of cigar workers born in Havana and living in Florida; none of them refer to the Abakua.</li>

                                256. Jesus Cruz (personal communication, 2000), Ekuenyon of the Ordan Efi lodge in Matanzas told me that he had heard that Tomas Sur! was
                                Abakua but that his lodge name was not known. After reading Sosa’s essay, Cruz responded that nothing in this article proves that Abakua
                                conducted ceremonies in Florida, nor are such activities known about by Abakua leadership in Cuba.</li>
                            <li>In spite of the errors in this essay, Sosa should be praised for his support ofAbakua culture in Cuba in the early 1980S in the form of his book
                                (Los afiigos), since it was an unpopular theme in the political sphere at the time.</li>
                            <li>Ishemo, “From Africa to Cuba,” 268. Ishemo falsely cited Muzio (Andres Quimbisa, 71) and Helg (Our Rightful Share, 87); there is no mention
                                in either of Marti, a Famba, or a flag. Ishemo also cited Sosa (“Nafiigos en Key West,” 167-68), who in turn cites Marti (“Una orden secreta de
                                africanos”), but Marti made no mention of Abakua. Marti wrote of a secret society of Cuban “Africans,” who had given up the drum in order to
                                learn to read-a non sequitur-and whose reunions took place in a “bannered hall … the hall whose parties were adorned with the banner of the
                                revolution” (“sala embanderada … la sala que adorna sus fiestas con la bandera de la revolucion”) (“Una orden secreta de africanos,”324). Sosa
                                imagined that Marti wrote of an Abakua group in Key West. Ishemo’s
                                piece is riddled with the uncritical repetition of errors, and poor translations.</li>

                            <li>The ceremony performed was the creation in Miami of the first Olofies, a ritual vessel possessed only by high-ranking babalawo. A 1978 Miami
                                newspaper article reporting on the event stated that the first Olofies were made by Yoruba babalawos in Havana more than “200 years” before.

                            <li>From a Miami newspaper article published in 1978, in the archives of Luis Fernandez-Pelon. There I saw and videotaped a photograph of Luis
                                Fernandez and two other Cubans in O~ogbo, Nigeria, in 1978, taken during their initiation as babalawos there. I also saw a photograph of Ifayemi

                            <li>David Brown reported that Gomez was initiated into the Lukumi Ocha system in 1929 (Santeria Enthroned, 160). This is consistent with the
                                early Cuban tradition that eligible males should be initiated into Abakua and Palo Mayombe before entering the Lukumi tradition. One
                                interpretation of this tradition is that the “Carabali” (from Calabar) and Central African “Kongo” people arrived to Cuba and other American
                                regions before the Yoruba/Lukumi.</li>
                            <li>David Brown reports that Gomez was “the first Cuban-born babalawo to have made Ifa in the United States” (Santeria Enthroned, 325 n. 92).
                                The Cuban-Kongo lineage called Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje was organized by Andres Petit in the mid-1800s (cf. Cabrera, La Regia Kimbisa del

                            <li>In this era in Cuba, February 24 was a national holiday-thus a day free from work-to celebrate the “El grito de Baire” (the Cry of Baire), the
                                commencement of the final war of independence in 1895 by the Cuban rebels against Spain. Being a carnival day in the 1890S, this date was
                                chosen to start a rebellion under the cover of a mass celebration.</li>

                            <li>Sanchez created “Manungo’s Diablito Dancers” in the 1930S to depict Sanchez’s memories of the “fidfiigo street dance” in 1919. Some scholars
                                thought that this was an Abakua performance, but in fact the body-masks were Puerto Rican Vejigantes, not Abakua. The work represents a
                                street jam session with a bongo player, a trumpet player, and two body-masquerades, in the context of carnival. 1. Miller, Voice of the Leopard .</li>
